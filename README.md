Hi! 👋

This is a school project for PPT – Product Prototyping Tools.
I made this website so I could use it with my friends while playing Phasmophobia.

The tool helps you quickly identify the correct ghost type based on the evidence you collect.
You can also create a team, and everyone in the team will get live updates as evidence is added or removed — super useful during co-op games!
